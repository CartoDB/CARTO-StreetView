# CARTO-StreetView
#### Proof of concept
Little lib to add contextual Google StreetView functionality to CARTO.js application

Functionality so far:
* Click anywhere to open a StreetView infowindow
* Move within StreetView and the PoV marker will move and rotate on the fly to fit the PoV in StreetView
* Drag the PoV marker to other location and the StreetView availability layer will be displayed while dragging
